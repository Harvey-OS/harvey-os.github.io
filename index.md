## What is Harvey? 

Harvey is an effort to provide a modern, distributed, 64 bit operating system. A different environment for researching and finding new lines of work. It can be built with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> and <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> and has an [ANSI/POSIX compliant subsystem](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki).

For now it runs in x86_64 (amd64) machines, [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) and soon in ARMv8 (AArch64/A64). We are improving the kernel and userland, trying to bring up a full usable operating system that is different and, at the same time, keeps ideas and concepts from other platforms that influenced the computing world for years.
