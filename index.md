# Harvey OS
### A distributed operating system

## What is Harvey?

Harvey is an effort to provide a modern, distributed, 64 bit operating system. A different environment for researching and finding new lines of work. It can be built with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> and <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> and has an [ANSI/POSIX compliant subsystem](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/apex/wiki).

It runs on x86_64 (amd64) machines. Main work is focused in improving the kernel and userland, trying to bring up a full usable operating system with common tools for development and a USB installation image. It collects many different ideas and concepts that, across many platforms and operating systems, influenced the computing world for years.

Harvey is open source, and it is distributed under [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html).
