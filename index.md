# Harvey OS

Harvey is an experimental operating system based on the MIT-licensed release of [Plan 9](https://p9f.org). The primary goals of the Harvey project are:

* To build a Plan 9 distribution which is extremely easy to deploy.
* To ship (and, where necessary, implement from scratch) a useful Go-based userspace.
* To modernize existing C code as much as possible.
* To improve the kernel, potentially allowing the inclusion of kernel code implemented in new languages such as Rust.

Please note that the Harvey source code has recently been [rebased](/2021/07/23/rebase.html) and it may be some time before all documentation is updated.
