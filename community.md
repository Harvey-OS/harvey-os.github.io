Harvey has a small group of enthusiasts that spend their free time on it,
looking, experimenting, testing... but in order to keep things on track, 
there is a small group of people we usually call "core team" making
decisions on what gets merged. These people know the system well and are
a good resource if you have questions. You can find them on the Slack or
the mailing list.

Come and meet Harvey! it's a lovely rabbit (in case you could see it).
