After loss of traction, the Harvey team has decided to retire Harvey and move on.

We have created something new that we named [R9](https://github.com/r9os/r9), an OS strongly inspired by Plan 9, written in the Rust programming language.

We're still hanging out in the [Harvey community chat](/community), discussing ideas for R9 and around Plan 9. Feel free to join us and say hi! :)
