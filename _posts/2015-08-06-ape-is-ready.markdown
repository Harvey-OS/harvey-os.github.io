###### APE (the [ANSI/POSIX Environment](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/ape.html)) has been finally given the green light:

 ANSI people, it's your time. Let's go, doors are opened. Ape is working.
 Improvements, suggestions are welcome. Ports can be done. Wiki is ready in github.

###### This means a whole host of ports can be on their way fueled by POSIX -sort of- compliance:

  There are some aspects of required POSIX behavior that are impossible or very hard to simulate in Plan 9.
  Experience has shown, however, that the simulation is adequate for the vast majority of programs.

A quick [getting started with APE](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/ape/wiki/Getting-Started) guide is being drafted in the wiki.
