Harvey has a new feature in X86_64 (amd64) architecture: now it uses the [Virtio](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio) capabilities provided by QEMU. Follow our [wiki](https://github.com/Harvey-OS/harvey/wiki/Using-Virtio-(QEMU)) for more info. Thanks to Dmitry Golubovsky for his efforts and patience, showing that Harvey community is always happy to meet new members and receiving proposals that could grow the system.
We hope this will encourage more people to jump to the sand and come to Harvey OS community for learning, teaching and getting some fun coding.
