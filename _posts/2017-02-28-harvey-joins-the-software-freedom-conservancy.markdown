We are very pleased to announce that Harvey OS is now an official member of the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2017/feb/28/harveyos-joins/).

In its own words Conservancy "is a not-for-profit charity that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects. Conservancy provides a non-profit home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects. This allows FLOSS developers to focus on what they do best — writing and improving FLOSS for the general public — while Conservancy takes care of the projects' needs that do not relate directly to software development and documentation."

Harvey's membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy allows us to accept donations, support new contributors and grow the community.

This is a great step for HarveyOS, giving it the possibility of making its own little place in our big Free Software community. Co-founders and contributors are all from very differents countries and cultures and working together it's always something nice. People who started this project wanted since the begining in having fun coding (again), doing it for everyone, showing it, teaching about it. And surely, joining Conservancy will grow this spirit.

From here we thank to Karen Sandler, Tony Sebro, Brett Smith and Bradley M. Kuhn for helping us to making this possible.
